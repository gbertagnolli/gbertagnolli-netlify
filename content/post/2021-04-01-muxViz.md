I had the great opportunity to contribute to [muxViz](https://github.com/manlius/muxViz), building the R package `muxViz` that now can be installed as easy as
```R
devtools::install_github("manlius/muxViz")
```

I built the [package website](https://manlius.github.io/muxViz) using `pkgdown` (cf.[pkgdown.r-lib.org](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)), which makes the whole process easy (and fun).

There is still work to do&ndash;enriching the documentation and fixing bugs, among others&ndash;before releasing it to CRAN, but it's still a result and a pleasure.
Realising code makes Scientific Research and Science better!
