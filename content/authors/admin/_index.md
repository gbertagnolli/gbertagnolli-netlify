I am a PhD student at the Complex Multilayer Networks Lab at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler, in Trento. 

Here, I work on network geometry, a field at the intersection between complex networks (graph and spectral graph theory), geometry (differential, discrete, information, and spectral geometry), and dynamical systems (stochastic processes).
The first review (Boguñá et al. 2021) on this topic is very recent, it was published only in January 2021!

Boguñá, Marián, Ivan Bonamassa, Manlio De Domenico, Shlomo Havlin, Dmitri Krioukov, and M. Ángeles Serrano,. 2021. “Network Geometry” 3 (2): 114–35. [doi: 10.1038/s42254-020-00264-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42254-020-00264-4).
